  abstract = {In the context of the analysis of measured data, one is often faced
	with the task to differentiate data numerically. Typically, this
	occurs when measured data are concerned or data are evaluated numerically
	during the evolution of partial or ordinary differential equations.
	Usually, one does not take care for accuracy of the resulting estimates
	of derivatives because modern computers are assumed to be accurate
	to many digits. But measurements yield intrinsic errors, which are
	often much less accurate than the limit of the machine used, and
	there exists the effect of “loss of significance”, well known in
	numerical mathematics and computational physics. The problem occurs
	primarily in numerical subtraction, and clearly, the estimation of
	derivatives involves the approximation of differences. In this article,
	we discuss several techniques for the estimation of derivatives.
	As a novel aspect, we divide into local and global methods, and explain
	the respective shortcomings. We have developed a general scheme for
	global methods, and illustrate our ideas by spline smoothing and
	spectral smoothing. The results from these less known techniques
	are confronted with the ones from local methods. As typical for the
	latter, we chose Savitzky–Golay-filtering and finite differences.
	Two basic quantities are used for characterization of results: The
	variance of the difference of the true derivative and its estimate,
	and as important new characteristic, the smoothness of the estimate.
	We apply the different techniques to numerically produced data and
	demonstrate the application to data from an aeroacoustic experiment.
	As a result, we find that global methods are generally preferable
	if a smooth process is considered. For rough estimates local methods
	work acceptably well.},

	identifying the constitutive parameters of linear elastic materials

	approach is the virtual fields method (VFM). It is shown that the
	uncertainty of the parameters identified with the VFM when a white
	noise is added to the data depends on the choice of a relevant set
	of virtual fields. Optimal virtual fields exist, thus minimizing
	the uncertainty and providing the ‘‘maximum likelihood solution’’.
	The other approaches investigated in this paper are based on finite

	actually yield equations similar to the ones derived from the VFM,
	but with nonoptimal sets of virtual fields. Therefore, theFEMU approaches
	do not provide the ‘‘maximum likelihood solution’’. However, the
	uncertainty of FEMU approaches varies dramatically with the cost
	function to minimize. On one hand, the FEMU approach based on the
	‘‘displacement gap’’ minimization yields equations which are very
	close to the ones of the VFM approach and therefore, its uncertainty
	is almost the same as the VFM one. On the other hand, it is shown
	that other approaches based on the ‘‘constitutive equation gap’’
	minimization or the ‘‘equilibrium gap’’ minimization provide biased
	solutions. For all the approaches, very fast algorithms, converging
	in only two iterations, have been devised. They are finally applied

	The question addressed by this work is the following: can a filtering
	of the displacement measurement improve the results of the identification
	of elastic properties? The discussion is based on the study of a
	numerical example where the elastic parameters of an elastic structure
	with inhomogeneous properties are sought from synthetic data representative
	of in-plane full-field data. The displacement data are first filtered
	through a diffuse approximation algorithm, based on a moving least-squares
	approximation. Then, the identification of the elastic parameters
	is performed by an inverse approach based on the minimization of
	a cost function, defined as the least-squares gap between the experimental
	data and their numerical counterpart (finite element model updating).
	Within this framework, a first-order analysis is proposed in order
	to characterize the errors in the identified parameters, the measurement
	error characteristics being known. Results from raw and filtered
	displacement data are compared and discussed, filtering improving
	the identification for lower spatial resolution. The choice of the
	norm to define the gap between the experiment and the calculation
	is also discussed. For practical use and to take advantage of the
	proposed first-order methodology, two different ways can be considered:
	applying the methodology to a numerical example, representative of
	the experimental setup, to determine whether or not a filtering is
	valuable, and estimating the uncertainties of the identified parameters
	at the end of the identification process of an experimental characterization.},

	The formula is then validated using experimental data. Since rigid

  abstract = {Ductile failure of structural metals is relevant to a wide range of
	engineering scenarios. Computational methods are employed to anticipate
	the critical conditions of failure, yet they sometimes provide inaccurate
	and misleading predictions. Challenge scenarios, such as the one
	presented in the current work, provide an opportunity to assess the
	blind, quantitative predictive ability of simulation methods against
	a previously unseen failure problem. Rather than evaluate the predictions
	of a single simulation approach, the Sandia Fracture Challenge relies
	on numerous volunteer teams with expertise in computational mechanics
	to apply a broad range of computational methods, numerical algorithms,
	and constitutive models to the challenge. This exercise is intended
	to evaluate the state of health of technologies available for failure
	prediction. In the first Sandia Fracture Challenge, a wide range
	of issues were raised in ductile failure modeling, including a lack
	of consistency in failure models, the importance of shear calibration
	data, and difficulties in quantifying the uncertainty of prediction
	[see Boyce et al. (Int J Fract 186:5--68, 2014) for details of these
	observations]. This second Sandia Fracture Challenge investigated
	the ductile rupture of a Ti--6Al--4V sheet under both quasi-static
	and modest-rate dynamic loading (failure in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sim
	{\$}{\$} ∼ 0.1 s). Like the previous challenge, the sheet had an
	unusual arrangement of notches and holes that added geometric complexity
	and fostered a competition between tensile- and shear-dominated failure
	modes. The teams were asked to predict the fracture path and quantitative
	far-field failure metrics such as the peak force and displacement
	to cause crack initiation. Fourteen teams contributed blind predictions,
	and the experimental outcomes were quantified in three independent
	test labs. Additional shortcomings were revealed in this second challenge
	such as inconsistency in the application of appropriate boundary
	conditions, need for a thermomechanical treatment of the heat generation
	in the dynamic loading condition, and further difficulties in model
	calibration based on limited real-world engineering data. As with
	the prior challenge, this work not only documents the `state-of-the-art'
	in computational failure prediction of ductile tearing scenarios,
	but also provides a detailed dataset for non-blind assessment of
	alternative methods.},

	which makes noise reduction difficult. Local projective noise reduction
	is one of the most eective tools. It is based on proper orthogonal
	decomposition (POD), and works for both map-like and continuously
	sampled time series. However, POD only looks at geometrical or topological
	properties of data and does not take into account the temporal characteristics
	of time series. Here we present a new smooth projective noise reduction
	method. It uses smooth orthogonal decomposition (SOD) of bundles
	of reconstructed short-time trajectory strands to identify smooth
	local subspaces. Restricting trajectories to these subspaces imposes
	temporal smoothness on the filtered time series. It is shown that
	SOD-based noise reduction significantly outperforms the POD-based
	method for continuously sampled noisy time series.},

  abstract = {Tabu search (TS) is a metaheuristic, which proved efficient to solve
	various combinatorial optimization problems. However, few works deal
	with its application to the global minimization of functions depending
	on continuous variables. To perform this task, we propose an hybrid
	method combining tabu search and simplex search (SS). TS allows to
	cover widely the solution space, to stimulate the search towards
	solutions far from the current solution, and to avoid the risk of
	trapping into a local minimum. SS is used to accelerate the convergence
	towards a minimum. The Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm is a classical
	very powerful local descent algorithm, making no use of the objective
	function derivatives. A ‘‘simplex’’ is a geometrical figure consisting,
	in n-dimensions, of (n + 1) points. If any point of a simplex is
	taken as the origin, the n other points define vector directions
	that span the n-dimension vector space. Through a sequence of elementary
	geometric transformations (reflection, contraction and extension),
	the initial simplex moves, expands or contracts. To select the appropriate
	transformation, the method only uses the values of the function to
	be optimized at the vertices of the simplex considered. After each
	transformation, the current worst vertex is replaced by a better
	one. Our algorithm called continuous tabu simplex search (CTSS) implemented
	in two different forms (CTSSsingle, CTSSmultiple) is made up of two
	steps: first, an adaptation of TSto continuous optimization problems,
	allowing to localize a ‘‘promising area’’; then, intensification
	within this promising area, involving SS. The efficiency of CTSS
	is extensively tested by using analytical test functions of which
	global and local minima are known. A comparison is proposed with
	several variants of tabu search, genetic algorithms and simulated
	annealing. CTSS is applied to the design of a eddy current sensor
	aimed at non-destructive control.},

	from an adaptation of combinatorial Tabu Search which aims to follow,

	a wide domain of possible solutions, our algorithm first performs
	the diversification: it locates the most promising areas, by fitting
	the size of the neighborhood structure to the objective function
	and its definition domain. When the most promising areas are located,
	the algorithm continues the search by intensification within one
	promising area of the solution space. The efficiency of ECTS is thoroughly
	testd by using a set of benchmark multimodal functions, of which
	global and local minima are known. ECTS is compared to other published
	versions of continuous Tabu Search and to some alternative algorithms
	like Simulated Annealing. We point out two main advantages of ECTS:

	measuring equipment and simple analytical formulas to derive the

	include detailed discussion of influence factors for measurement
	accuracy such as window size and image noise, are conducted with
	digital deformed grids. The results verify that the WFT–GPA method
	not only keeps all advantages of traditional \{GPA\} method, but
	also owns a better accuracy for deformation measurement. Finally,
	the WFT–GPA method is applied to measure the machining distortion

	In this challenge, the prediction of load-deformation behavior and

	two loading rates is required with given data: the material Ti--6Al--4V,
	and raw data of tensile tests and V-notch tests under two loading
	rates. Within the stipulated time frame 14 teams from USA and Europe
	gave their predictions to the organizer. In this work, the approach
	applied by Team Aachen is presented in detail. The modified Bai--Wierzbicki
	(MBW) model is used in the framework of the Second Blind Sandia Fracture
	Challenge (SFC2). The model is made up by a stress-state dependent
	plasticity core that is extended to cope with strain rate and temperature
	effects under adiabatic conditions. It belongs to the group of coupled
	phenomenological ductile damage mechanics models, but it assumes
	a strain threshold value for the instant of ductile damage initiation.
	The initial guess of material parameters for the selected material
	Ti--6Al--4V was taken from an in-house database available at the
	authors' institutes, but parameters are optimized in order to meet
	the validation data provided. This paper reveals that the model predictions
	can be improved significantly compared to the original submission
	of results at the end of SFC2 by two simple measures. On the one
	hand, the function to express the critical damage as well as the
	amount of energy dissipation between ductile damage initiation and
	complete ductile fracture were derived more carefully from the data
	provided by the challenge's organizer. On the other hand, the experimental
	set-up of the challenge experiment was better described in the geometrical
	representation used for the numerical simulations. These two simple
	modifications allowed for a precise prediction of crack path and
	estimation of force--displacement behavior. The improved results
	show the general ability of the MBW model to predict the strain rate
	sensitivity of ductile fracture at various states of stress.},

  abstract = {Simulated annealing is a general purpose optimization technique for
	combinatorial optimization problems. In order to improve the efficiency
	of simulated annealing, the neighbourhood structure and the generation
	probabilities have to be designed carefully. Usually, this process
	is problem dependent and, hence, unlikely to be generally applicable
	to various combinatorial problems. In the present paper a general
	theory is introduced and proved to support the construction of efficient
	generation mechanisms. In order to reduce the complexity of the problem,
	a particular problem-dependent equivalence relation within the set
	S of all possible configurations can be defined, determining a quotient
	set within the original set S. If all optimal configurations are
	assigned to the same equivalence class, in order to find an optimal
	configuration, it suffices to wander within the quotient set instead
	of the original set S. If the average size of a non-optimal equivalence
	class is much larger than the size of the optimal class, the optimal
	configurations will be preferred during the annealing process. This
	translates to a significant reduction in CPU time. To avoid the need
	to compute the quotient set explicitly, the search procedure in the
	quotient set is simulated within the original set of configurations.
	Our approach has parallels with the ejection chain strategies used
	in tabu search, and our theory provides further motivation for such
	strategies (in addition to the combinatorial leverage theorems of
	tabu search). Applications to the channel assignment problem which
	occurs during the design of cellular radio systems demonstrate clearly
	the power of the general construction theory. With the new method
	we can construct generation mechanisms that reduce the exponential
	complexity of the configuration set to a polynomial dependence on
	the problem size, as characteristic of the combinatorial leverage

	method was first attempted on finite element (FE) generated data
	for a forward-reverse simple shear test to investigate its capability
	in retrieving the input constitutive parameters. The influence of
	noise was also evaluated. Then, the identification method was applied
	to a selection of advanced high strength steel (AHSS), namely DP600,
	TRIP780 and TWIP980, sheet specimens, subjected to a small number
	of forward-reverse simple shear cycles. The material constitutive
	parameters were identified using the VFM based on which shear stressâ€“strain
	curves were calculated and compared with their experimental counterparts.
	Good agreement was found between the calculated and the experimental
	curves despite the larger discrepancies observed in the reverse loading
	paths. To adjust these discrepancies, the original HAH model was
	modified with respect to the permanent softening related state variables.
	After modification, the model was simplified with only one state
	variable related to permanent softening. It was found that the discrepancies
	observed in the reverse loading paths were reduced with the modified
	HAH model.},

  abstract    = {Time parallel time integration methods have received renewed interest
	over the last decade because of the advent of massively parallel
	computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on
	today’s processors. When solving time dependent partial differential
	equations, the time direction is usually not used for parallelization.
	But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers
	itself as a further direction for parallelization. The time direction
	is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality
	principle: the solution later in time is affected (it is even determined)
	by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms
	trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore
	be special, and take this very different property of the time dimension
	into account. We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition
	methods were invented, and give an overview of the existing techniques.
	Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups:methods
	based on multiple shooting,methods based on domain decomposition
	and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct
	time parallel methods. We show for each of these techniques the main
	inventions over time by choosing specific publications and explaining
	the core ideas of the authors. This chapter is for people who want
	to quickly gain an overview of the exciting and rapidly developing
	area of research of time parallel methods.},

	of the specimen. Using an array of 128×80 (compression tests) and
	258×48 (tensile tests) pixels, the cameras record about 110,000 frames
	per second. A random dot pattern is applied to the surface of the
	specimens. The image correlation algorithm uses the dot pattern to
	define a field of overlapping virtual gage boxes, and the 3-D coordinates
	of the center of each gage box are determined at each frame. The
	coordinates are then used for calculating the strains throughout
	the surface of the specimen. The strains determined with the image
	correlation method are compared with those determined from analyzing
	the elastic waves in the bars, and with strains measured with strain
	gages placed on the specimens. The system is used to study the response
	of OFE C10100 copper. In compression tests, the image correlation
	shows a nearly uniform deformation which agrees with the average
	strain that is determined from the waves in the bars and the strains
	measured with strain gages that are placed directly on the specimen.
	In tensile tests, the specimen geometry and properties affect the
	outcome from the experiment. The full field strain measurement provides
	means for examining the validity and accuracy of the tests. In tests
	where the deforming section of the specimen is well defined and the
	deformation is uniform, the strains measured with the image correlation
	technique agree with the average strain that is determined from the
	split Hopkinson bar wave records. If significant deformation is taking
	place outside the gage section, and when necking develops, the strains
	determined from the waves are not valid, but the image correlation
	method provides the accurate full field strain history.},

  abstract = {Abstract—In this paper, the issue of the identification of constitutive
	parameters of the Anand visco-plastic model is addressed using the
	Virtual Fields Method (VFM) in an infinitesimal deformation framework.
	By using VFM, one can take advantage of heterogeneous strain fields
	obtained by full-field experimental techniques, such as Digital Image
	Correlation (DIC). Since a wide range of strains and strain rates
	are sampled in a typical heterogeneous strain field, the number of
	experiments required to reliably estimate constitutive parameters,
	especially of rate-dependent materials, is significantly smaller
	than that needed if conventional experiments (such as uniaxial tension
	or pure shear configurations) leading to nominally homogeneous strain
	states were used. However, for such an approach to be successful,
	the test configuration and loading program should be such that all
	the constitutive parameters play a significant role (are ‘activated’)
	in the resulting strain fields. An analysis of the Anand constitutive
	model shows that 4 of the 8 parameters can only be found to within
	a multiplicative constant from full-field kinematic data. Therefore,
	one of these 4 constants is arbitrarily chosen and the activation
	of the remaining 7 material parameters is investigated by performing
	a series of one-element models. Detailed sensitivities of the VFM
	cost function to these material parameters are derived for a variety
	of normal stress to shear stress ratios and loading rates. Two main
	conclusions are drawn based on this one-element study: (i) the VFM
	cost function sensitivities to the material parameters do not vary
	significantly with loading ratios or rates, and (ii) 2 of the 7 material
	parameters are not activated for any of the loading ratios or rates
	considered. Based on the results of the finite-element study, a modified
	single lap-shear test configuration is designed to yield heterogeneous
	strains in the joint. Deformation data from a finite-element analysis
	of this experiment are used as inputs to a VFM routine to compute
	the Anand material parameters. Our results highlight that non-uniqueness
	of the identified parameters is a significant issue. The effect of
	the choice of the cost function and the loading profile on the inverse
	technique is also thoroughly investigated.},

	Steel (ASS) 304 at elevated temperatures the extended Rusinek–Klepaczko
	(RK) model has been modified using an exponential strain dependent
	term for dynamic strain aging (DSA) region. Isothermal tensile tests
	are conducted on ASS 304 for a temperature range of 323–923K with
	an interval of 50K and at strain rates of 0.0001s−1, 0.001s−1, 0.01s−1
	and 0.1s−1. DSA phenomenon is observed from 623 to 923K at 0.0001s−1,
	0.001s−1 and 0.01s−1. Material constants are calculated using data
	obtained from these tensile tests for non-DSA and DSA region separately.
	The predicted results from the RK model are compared with the experimental
	data to check the accuracy of the constitutive relation. It is observed
	that to find out the constants of this model, some initial assumptions
	are required, and these initial values affect the predicted values.
	Hence, Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the constants for
	RK model. Statistical measures such as the correlation coefficient,
	the average absolute error and standard deviation are used to measure
	the accuracy of the model. The resulting values of the correlation
	coefficient for ASS 304 for non-DSA and DSA region using modified
	extended RK model are 0.9828 and 0.9701. This modified, extended
	RK model is compared with Johnson–Cook (JC), Zerilli–Armstrong (ZA)
	and Arrhenius models and it is observed that specifically in DSA
	region, the modified extended RK model gives highly accurate predictions.},

  abstract = {Ductile fracture of metals occurs as a result of nucleation, growth
	and coalescence of microscopic voids that initiate at inclusions
	and second phase particles. The main parameters that influence void
	nucleation and growth, and hence ductile fracture, are the triaxiality
	factor and the plastic strain. The triaxiality factor is widely used
	as a constraint parameter. Recent advances highlight the loss of
	Jdominance in low constraint geometries and the importance of using
	two-parameter theories, namely JT and J-Q to characterise near crack
	front states of yielded crack geometries. In this paper we use three-dimensional
	finite element models of low constraint geometries to study the variation
	of the triaxiality factor, plastic strain and Q-value with the deformation
	level. Comparisons between the triaxiality factor, the plastic strain
	and the Q-value are made at different distances ahead of the crack
	front. Our numerical results show that, for a given material, there
	exists a unique linear relationship between the triaxiality factor
	and the Q-value that is independent of specimen geometry, dimensions,
	crack depth and deformation level. This unique relationship shows
	that the Q-value can be used as a ductile fracture parameter as it
	parameterises both the stress triaxiality and the plastic strain.
	It can be concluded that the Q-value and the stress triaxiality factor
	are equivalent constraint parameters.},

	the constitutive behavior of Armox 500T steel and armor piercing
	incendiary projectile (API) material under varying stress state,
	strain rate and temperature. The characterization of Armox 500T steel
	showed increase in its strength with increase in stress triaxiality
	as well as strain rate. Increment in temperature, on the other hand,
	induced significant increase in the material ductility while reducing
	its strength. The \{API\} projectile material remained insensitive
	to stress-triaxiality and strain rate; however, it was highly sensitive
	to thermal effects. Results thus obtained from experiments on the
	specimens of both the materials were subsequently employed for calibrating
	the material parameters of Johnson–Cook (JC) flow and fracture model.
	The calibrated \{JC\} model for Armox 500T steel has been validated
	by numerically simulating the high strain rate tension tests performed
	on split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. The ballistic experiments
	were carried out wherein 8 and 10 mm thick Armox 500T steel target
	plates were impacted by 7.62 and 12.7 \{API\} projectiles respectively
	at a normal incidence with a velocity of nearly 830 m/s. The results
	of the ballistic tests were reproduced through finite element simulations
	performed on ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code employing calibrated
	\{JC\} model for the target as well as the projectile material. Experimental
	and numerical findings with respect to failure mechanism and ballistic
	resistance of the target are presented and discussed. It is seen
	that the computed failure modes and residual velocities accurately
	matched the experiments. Further, the ballistic limit of the target
	material was obtained numerically and the values obtained were validated
	through the Recht–Ipson empirical model.},

	problems (UIPs) which are a class of inverse problems with uncertainty
	in the system parameters of the forward model. Interval which represents
	a closed bounded set of real numbers is used to model and characterize
	the uncertainty in our formulation, and hence only the bounds of
	the uncertainty of the system parameters are needed. For a specific
	input vector, the possible values of the outputs form an interval
	vector because of the uncertainty. An error function is defined using
	the measured interval vector of the outputs and those computed using
	a forward model. The UIP is then formulated as an optimization problem
	which minimizes the error function. To improve the optimization efficiency,
	an interval forward model is constructed based on the interval analysis
	method which can calculate very efficiently the bounds of the outputs
	caused by the uncertainty of the system parameters. The present method
	is applied to a complex inverse problem, namely material characterization
	of composite laminates using elastic waves. Uncertainty of load is

	the transient displacement responses. The engineering constants of
	two kinds of laminates are successfully identified using the simulated

  abstract = {Titanium is an important candidate in the search for lighter weight
	armors. Increasingly, it is being considered as a replacement for
	steel components. It is also an important component in the application
	of ceramics to armor systems, especially in armor modules that are
	capable of defeating kinetic energy penetrators while sustaining
	little or no penetration of the ceramic element. The best alloy available
	today for ballistic applications is Ti-6AI-4V, an aerospace grade
	titanium alloy. The principal deterrent to widespread use of this
	alloy as an armor material is cost, and a significant portion of
	the cost is in processing. Consequently, the U.S. Army Research Laboratory
	undertook a program to study a particular lower cost processing technique
	[1]. The objectives of this work are to characterize the low-cost
	titanium alloy by generating constants for the Johnson-Cook (JC)
	and Zerilli-Armstrong (ZA) strength models, and to use and compare
	these two models in simulations of ballistic experiments. High strain
	rate sla'ength data for the low-cost titanium alloy are used to generate
	parameters for the two models. The approach to fitting the JC parameters
	follows one previously used successfully to model 2-in thick rolled
	homogeneous armor (RHA) [2]. The approach to fitting the ZA parameters
	is based on a method described by Gray et al. [3]. The resulting
	model parameters are used in the shock physics code CTH [4] to model
	a Ti-6AI-4V penetrator penetrating a Ti-6AI-4V semi-infinite block
	at impact velocities up to 2,000 m/s. Similar experiments are performed,
	and the predictions of the two models are compared to each other
	and to the experimental results.},

	functional based on the difference between the experimental and FE-calculated
	displacement and strain fields. Due to the large deformations an
	adaptive meshing technique is used in order to avoid highly distorted

Distributions of temporal derivatives, i.e. strain rate, velocity and acceleration, over the area of interest are computed using the in-plane displacement and strain fields measured from image correlation. Complex deformation patterns resulting from wave propagation and inertial loading are studied and discussed.

This report describes the im- plementation and evaluation of VFM primarily for nite-deformation plasticity constitutive models. VFM was successfully implemented in MATLAB and evaluated using simulated FEM data that included representative experimental noise found in the Digital Image Cor- relation (DIC) optical technique that provides full-eld displacement measurements. VFM was able to identify constitutive model parameters for the BCJ plasticity model even in the presence of simulated DIC noise, demonstrating VFM as a viable alternative inverse method. Further research is required before VFM can be adopted as a standard method for constitu- tive model parameter identication, but this study is a foundation for ongoing research at Sandia for improving constitutive model calibration.},

	in the region of localised deformation[ Reasonable agreement was
	obtained between the experimental results and the numerical predictions

	is satisfied in a weighted-average sense over time-step by means
	of a weak form of the Galerkin procedure. The displacement, velocity,

	errors, and by controlling overshooting and algorithmic damping for
	higher modes. Recommandations for the values of those parameters
	have also been obtained. The generalized method is simple to implement.

  abstract = {Radial basis functions are “isotropic”; i.e., under a rotation, the
	basis function is left unchanged and is obtained as a function of
	a distance on the space. For Euclidean space this is not a problem
	since there is a natural metric. To extend radial basis functions
	to space-time, i.e., Rm × T, either a zonal anisotropy has to be
	incorporated or a metric must be defined on space-time. While the
	sum of two valid radial basis functions defined on different dimensional
	spaces is generally only semidefinite on the product space, the product
	of two positive definite functions on lower dimensional spaces is
	positive definite on the product space. This construction can be
	extended in several ways including a product-sum, integrated product,
	and the integrated product-sum. Examples are given for each construction
	and an application is given. The constructions are equally applicable
	to extending from space to space-time or for splitting higher-dimensional
	Euclidean spaces into the product of several lower-dimensional spaces.},

  abstract = {The requirement of a fast and accurate modulus identification technique
	has arisen in many fields of research, such as solid mechanics, structural
	health monitoring, medical diagnosis, etc. An inverse technique based
	on an appropriate interpretation of the principle of virtual work,
	namely the virtual fields method, has been proposed in the literature,
	which is able to return elastic modulus values after a single matrix
	inversion. An extension of the virtual fields method to the spatial
	frequency domain in order to determine modulus distributions of materials
	based on a sine/cosine parameterisation of the unknown modulus is
	developed in this thesis, and will be called the Fourier-series-based
	Virtual Fields Method (F-VFM). The technique accepts in-plane (two-dimensional)
	or volumetric (three-dimensional) deformation measurement data as
	its input. An efficient numerical algorithm of the F-VFM based on
	the fast Fourier transform is presented, which can return thousands
	of unknown Fourier coefficients within a minute thus reducing the
	computation time by several orders of magnitude compared to a direct
	implementation of the F-VFM for typical dataset sizes. The F-VFM
	technique is also adapted to cope with a common situation in experimental
	mechanics where the knowledge of the boundary conditions is limited.
	The three versions of the F-VFM in this situation are respectively
	the ‘experimental traction’, ‘windowed traction’ and ‘Fourier-series
	traction’ approaches. The technique is then validated with numerical
	data from different stiffness patterns. The performance is compared
	to that of an iterative updating technique based on a genetic algorithm
	for one of these patterns, and computational effort is demonstrated
	to be at least five orders of magnitude less for the new F-VFM than
	for this updating method. The sensitivity of the performance of the
	FVFM to noise is also investigated. Finally, the technique is applied
	to experimental data in both 2-D and 3-D cases with promising results.},

	method based on the principle of virtual work (PVW), is being increasingly
	used to estimate mechanical properties of materials from fullfield
	deformations obtained from techniques such as Digital Image Correlation,
	moir\'e and speckle interferometry and grid methods. By making specific
	choices for virtual fields (VFs) in PVW, one obtains a system of
	algebraic equations, which is then solved for the unknown material
	constants. Recently, a new variant of VFM, known as the Eigenfunction
	Virtual Fields Method (EVFM) has been proposed (Subramanian, 2013).
	In EVFM, principal components of the measured (i.e. true) strain
	fields are used to systematically generate VFs. We extend EVFM to
	orthotropic elastic materials in this work, and estimate the relevant
	material parameters from full-field strain data generated from a
	finite-element model of an unnotched Iosipescu test. Varying levels
	of Gaussian white noise are added to the synthetic strain data to
	evaluate the sensitivity of EVFM to input noise. It is observed that
	for low to moderate noise, the material properties estimated by the
	proposed method are relatively insensitive to noise. However, when
	noise levels are high, the proposed method yields large variance
	in some of the computed properties when compared to the state-of-the-art
	optimized piecewise continuous VFM (Toussaint et al., 2006; Pierron
	and Grediac, 2012). Some of the large variance in properties estimated
	from noisy data using EVFM is traced to the sensitivity of the third
	dominant eigenfunction and modifications to the proposed method to
	address this issue are suggested.},

	Classical procedures are restricted to the treatment of homogeneous

	needed to characterise complex behaviour models. On the contrary,

	In this paper, results of a comprehensive experimental and numerical

	of stresses and deformations in the shear zone and the presence of
	a hydrostatic stress next to the shear stress, while the latter primarily
	governs the initiation of the ASB. The relation between the global

	passenger safety systems. These codes have proven remarkably reliable
	for the prediction of ductile metal structures that deform plastically;
	however, they are not reliable for joining systems and materials
	such as high strength steels, plastics and low ductility lightweight
	materials all of which are liable to fracture during the crash event.
	In order to improve crash failure prediction of materials and joining
	systems the CEC has recently funded a 3 year European research project
	dedicated to this topic. Specifically the project concerned aluminium,
	magnesium, high strength steels, plastics and two primary joining
	techniques; namely spotwelds and weldlines. Numerous new developments
	were undertaken including improved failure laws, adaptive meshing
	and element splitting to treat crack propagation. In the case of
	sheet stamping, investigations have also tried to account for process
	history effects and the metallurgical changes that occur during manufacture.
	This project has recently finished and this paper presents some of
	the key research results of the work concerning materials failure
	modelling.},

  abstract = {For one decade, spalling techniques based on the use of a metallic
	Hopkinson bar in contact with a concrete sample have been widely
	employed to characterise the dynamic tensile strength of concrete
	at strain rates ranging from a few tens to hundreds of s-1. However,
	the processing method based on the use of the velocity profile measured
	on the rear free surface of the sample (Novikov formula) remains
	quite basic. In particular, the identification of the whole softening
	behaviour of the concrete material is currently out of reach. In
	the present paper, a new processing technique is proposed based on
	the use of the virtual fields method (VFM). First, a digital ultra-high-speed
	camera is used to record the pictures of a grid bonded onto the specimen.
	Then, images of the grid recorded by the camera are processed to
	obtain full-field axial displacement maps at the surface of the specimen.
	Finally, a specific virtual field has been defined in the VFM equation
	to use the acceleration map as an alternative ‘load cell’. This method
	applied to three spalling tests with different impact parameters
	allowed the identification of Young’s modulus during the test. It
	was shown that this modulus is constant during the initial compressive
	part of the test and decreases in the tensile part when microdamage
	exists. It was also shown that in such a simple inertial test, it
	was possible to reconstruct average axial stress profiles using only
	the acceleration data. It was then possible to construct local stress–strain
	curves and derive a tensile strength value.},

	of damage growth and fracture initiation in finitely deforming ductile
	solids. The material presented is of particular relevance to the
	simulation of industrial metal forming operations characterised by
	the presence of extreme deformations and strains, often resulting
	in localised material deterioration with possible fracture nucleation
	and growth. In this context, we focus on the crucial issues of constitutive
	modelling, low order finite element technology for near-incompressibility
	and adaptive mesh refinement. Constitutive modelling is treated within
	the framework of continuum damage mechanics. The effect of micro-crack
	closure, which may dramatically decrease the rate of damage growth
	under compression, is incorporated and its computational implementation
	is discussed. The use of low order elements in the presence of high
	nearly-isochoric plastic strains is addressed with the introduction
	of a methodology whereby the volumetric constraint is enforced over
	patches of simplex elements. This allows the effective use of simplex
	tetrahedra––for which intricate contact conditions as well as mesh
	generation over complex evolving geometries can be easily treated––without
	the volumetric locking typically associated with conventional low
	order displacement-based elements. With the aim of achieving an effective
	and robust adaptive strategy for this class of problems, it is important
	to design a damage-based error indicator which represents the essential
	features of the physical phenomena under consideration. The underlying
	idea is to correlate the adaptive procedure with the failure mechanism.
	The effectiveness of the resulting framework is demonstrated by the
	solution of relevant problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a new experimental technique is reported to
	study behavior of sheet metals in the range of low and high strain
	rates. The main purpose of this work was to analyse visco-plastic
	behavior of sheet metals for an industrial application. It may be
	mentioned that a variety of industrial processes, such as drawing
	or even crashworthiness, involve a wide range of strain rates. The
	test method which is based on previous work, (Klepaczko, J.R., 1994.
	An experimental technique for shear testing at high and very high
	strain rates. The case of mild steel. Int. J. Impact Engng. 15, 25–39),
	is a combination of two experimental techniques, that enables one
	to obtain the range of strain rates from 10−4 to 103 s−1, (Rusinek,
	A., Klepaczko, J.R., 1998. Etude experimentale du double cisaillement
	des tôles, modélisation de l'écoulement viscoplastique. Rapport interne,
	LPMM). The double-shear specimen is loaded by a fast hydraulic machine,
	and in the second case a specimen of the same geometry can be loaded
	by the direct impact of a projectile. The combination of direct impact
	with the double shear specimen, which is based on the Hopkinson tube
	technique of force measurement, permits to reduce the rise time of
	loading in comparison to the bar-tube configuration (Campbell, J.D.,
	Ferguson, W.G., 1970. The temperature and strain rate dependence
	of shear strength of mild steel. Phil. Mag. 21, 63–82). The combination
	of two schemes of loading assures a complete determination of the
	shear stress τ(t), the shear strain Γ(t) and shear strain rate Γ̇(t)
	as a function of time at wide range of strain rates. The test method
	has been applied to determine the visco-plastic behavior of cold
	rolled, Al-calmed sheet steel used in the automotive industry. The
	experimental results obtained with those two experimental techniques
	are in agreement with other reported data. An original visco-plastic
	constitutive relation has been proposed. It permits to model the
	viscoplastic behavior of the sheet metal tested in the whole range
	of strain rates considered. A general procedure for the identification
	of the material constants is proposed (Rusinek, A., Klepaczko, J.R.,
	1998. Etude experimentale du double cisaillement des tôles, modélisation
	de l'ecoulement viscoplatique. Rapport interne, LPMM.). It offers
	the advantage of subdividing the total number of constants into groups,
	this procedure simplifies the problem of identification. The constitutive
	relation proposed takes into account the strain hardening, the strain
	rate sensitivity and temperature effects. A comparison with experimental
	results is presented in the form of stress–strain curves at different
	strain rates, up to 103 s−1.},

	Method (EVFM) are inverse tech-niques for estimating constitutive
	properties from full-field experimental data. In these, a set of
	virtualfields is used in the Principle of Virtual Work (PVW) to yield
	a system of algebraic equations for theunknown material parameters.
	In a typical experiment, one does not know the distribution of tractionsover
	the external surface of the specimen, but the total force is generally
	measured. In order to still enableevaluation of the external virtual
	work integral that appears in PVW, in all the work to date on VirtualFields
	methods, the virtual displacements are restricted to be uniform over
	the portion of the exteriorsurface where tractions are prescribed
	so that the external virtual work is simply the inner product of
	theknown total force vector and the uniform value of the chosen virtual
	displacement vector. In this work,we show that this constraint can
	be relaxed to obtain a more flexible version of EVFM. The proposedmodification
	is used to obtain orthotropic elastic constants from a simulated
	unnotched Iosipescu test,and is shown to yield tighter estimates
	than previously obtained wherein the boundary virtual displace-ments
	were constrained to be uniform. This approach, which is novel to
	Virtual Fields methods, allows usto include domains in the interior
	of the specimen and therefore, results in an EVFM formulation capableof
	dealing with material heterogeneity, missing data and discontinuities

	an alternative approach for solving continuous, non-convex optimization

	was developed to improve the quality of the estimate obtained through
	the measurement process. The main advantage of HKA, compared to other
	metaheuristics, lies in the small number of parameters that need
	to be set by the user. Further, it is shown that HKA converges almost
	surely to a near-optimal solution. The efficiency of HKA was evaluated
	in detail using several non-convex test problems, both in the unconstrained
	and constrained cases. The results were then compared to those obtained
	via other metaheuristics. The numerical experiments show that HKA
	is a promising approach for solving non-convex optimization problems,

	mechanical test to characterise the material elastic stiffness parameters
	of an orthotropic PVC foam material in one single test. Two main
	experimental techniques were used in this study: Digital Image Correlation
	(DIC) and the Virtual Fields Method (VFM). The actual image recording
	process was mimicked by numerically generating a series of deformed
	synthetic images. Subsequent to this, the entire measurement and
	data processing procedure was simulated by processing the synthetic
	images using DIC and VFM algorithms. This procedure was used to estimate
	the uncertainty of the measurements (systematic and random errors)
	by including the most significant parameters of actual experiments,
	e.g. the geometric test configuration, the parameters of the DIC
	process and the noise. By using these parameters as design variables
	and by defining different error functions as object functions, an
	optimisation study was performed to minimise the uncertainty of the
	material parameter identification and to select the optimal test
	parameters. The confidence intervals of the identified parameters
	were predicted based on systematic and random errors obtained from
	the simulations. The simulated experimental results have shown that
	averaging multiple images can lead to a significant reduction of
	the random error. An experimental determination of the elastic coefficient
	of a PVC foam material was conducted using the optimised test parameters
	obtained from the numerical study. The identified stiffness values
	matched well with data from previous tests, but even more interesting
	was the fact that the experimental uncertainty intervals matched
	reasonably well with the predictions of the simulations, which is
	a highly original result and probably the main outcome of the present

	Correlation (DIC) in combination with the Virtual Fields Method (VFM).
	A modified Arcan fixture is used to induce various loading conditions
	ranging from pure shear or axial loading in tension or compression
	to bidirectional loading. A numerical optimization study was performed
	with different loading angles of the Arcan test fixture and off-axis
	angles of the principal material axes. The objective is to identify
	the configuration that gives the minimum sensitivity to noise and
	missing data on the specimen edges, which are the two major issues
	when identifying the stiffness components from actual DIC measurements.
	Two optimized Arcan test configurations were chosen. The experimental
	results obtained for these two optimized test configurations show
	a significant improvement of the measurement accuracy compared with
	a pure shear load configuration. The larger sensitivity of the pure
	shear test to missing data as opposed to the tensile test is also
	evident from the experimental data and confirms the analysis from
	the optimization study. The recovery of missing data along the specimen
	edges is a promising way to further improve the identification results.},

  abstract = {Finite element model updating is an inverse problem based on measured
	structural outputs, typically natural frequencies. Full-field responses
	such as static stress/strain patterns and vibration mode shapes contain
	valuable information for model updating but within large volumes
	of highly-redundant data. Pattern recognition and image processing
	provide feasible techniques to extract effective and efficient information,
	often known as shape features, from this data. For instance, the
	Zernike polynomials having the properties of orthogonality and rotational
	invariance are powerful decomposition kernels for a shape defined
	within a unit circle. In this paper, full field strain patterns for
	a specimen, in the form of a square plate with a circular hole, under
	a tensile load are considered. Effective shape features can be constructed
	by a set of modified Zernike polynomials. The modification includes
	the application of a weighting function to the Zernike polynomials
	so that high strain magnitudes around the hole are well represented.
	The Gram-Schmidt process is then used to ensure orthogonality for
	the obtained decomposition kernels over the domain of the specimen.
	The difference between full-field strain patterns measured by digital
	image correlation (DIC) and reconstructed using 15 shape features
	(Zernike moment descriptors, ZMDs) at different steps in the elasto-plastic
	deformation of the specimen is found to be very small. It is significant
	that only a very small number of shape features are necessary and
	sufficient to represent the full-field data. Model updating of nonlinear
	elasto-plastic material properties is carried out by adjusting the
	parameters of a FE model until the FE strain pattern converges upon
	the measured strains as determined using ZMDs.},

  abstract = {Rendering speckle images affected by a given deformation field is of primary importance to assess the metrological performance of displacement measurement methods used in experimental mechanics and based on digital image correlation (DIC). This article describes how to render deformed speckle images with a classic model of stochastic geometry, the Boolean model. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not depend on any interpolation scheme likely to bias the assessment process, and that it allows the user to render speckle images deformed with any deformation field given by an analytic formula. The proposed algorithm mimics the imaging chain of a digital camera, and its parameters are carefully discussed. A MATLAB software implementation and synthetic ground-truth datasets for assessing DIC software programs are publicly available.},

They identified an inappropriate assumption in the as-calculated integrals in Eqs. (10) and (14) in the original article [1]. In this regard, integrals denoting internal virtual work (Eq. (10) in the original article) and virtual work of the acceleration (Eq. (14) in the original article) were calculated assuming spatially-constant variables. As shown in the original results, this assumption is inappropriate. Fortunately, updating the assumption only affects results in the last part of the paper, Section 3.4 “visco-plastic constitutive model parameter identification”. Corrections have been made and the final results have been recalculated and presented in this corrigendum. Some additional discussion is also provided to give a deeper insight regarding the enhancement of the constitutive model identification.},

  abstract = {Testing tungsten carbide cermets at high strain rates is difficult due to their high stiffness and brittle failure mode. Therefore, the aim of this study is to apply the image-based inertial impact (IBII) test methodology to analyse the high strain rate properties of tungsten carbide cermets. The IBII test uses an edge on impact test configuration with a narrow stress pulse. The narrow input pulse travels through the specimen in compression and reflects in tension causing failure. Full-field measurements of acceleration and strain are then coupled with the virtual fields method to identify the stiffness components and tensile strength of a test sample at high strain rates. Image deformation simulations were used to select optimal test processing parameters and predict the associated experimental errors. The elastic modulus and tensile strength of the tested tungsten carbide cermet samples were successfully identified using the IBII test at strain rates on the order of {\$}{\$}1000{\textasciitilde}{\backslash}text{\{}s{\}}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}1000s-1. No significant strain rate dependence was detected for either the stiffness or tensile strength.},

The structure is discretized using the Finite Element method, while for the fluid domain the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian and the hybrid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics-Finite Element method are employed. First, the structural models are thoroughly validated ensuring differences arising from the use of two software packages to be as small as possible. Secondly, selected benchmark cases of guided ditching experiments are simulated with both numerical approaches and numerical results are compared with experimental data. A good agreement is found for pressure, normal force, and strain time histories. Finally, modeling aspects affecting the results such as the effects of the plasticity computation algorithm, air, and model simplifications are discussed.},

This paper investigates methods for improving such efficiency through the use of partially converged computational fluid dynamics results. These allow surrogate models to be built in a fraction of the time required for models based on converged results. The proposed optimization methodologies increase the speed of convergence to a global optimum while the computer resources expended in areas of poor designs are reduced. A strategy which combines a global approximation built using partially converged simulations with expected improvement updates of converged simulations is shown to outperform a traditional surrogate-based optimization.},
